FIFO is the simplest algorithm a scheduler could implement

We want to know who decides who runs first 

A multi-level feedback queue is one where the scheduler uses the recent past to predict the future

The workload is the name given to the collective processes running in the system 

The metric we will use to compare different scheduling policies is the turnaround time defined by this formula:
T_turnaround = T_completion - T_arrival

What do you think the problem with FIFO is?

Think of a sekelten0 of a SJF algorithm 

explain to me a scenario showcasing the flaw in the SJF algorithm

Explain to me how does the STCF work

What is the problem with STCF policy and why is it no longer used as much

What is the difference between the response time and the time of turnaround

Imagine a real life scenario for which response time is bad but turnaround time is good.

explain the RR scheduling policy

What decision does the scheduler make when a job initiates an I/O request and becomes blocked?
